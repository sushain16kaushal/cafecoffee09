            <p className=' text-gray-500  mt-7'>Welcome to CoffeeHut, your cozy corner for every coffee moment. What started as a small dream to create the perfect cup has grown into a place where coffee isn’t just a drink — it’s an experience. We carefully select the finest beans, roast them to perfection, and craft each beverage with love, from rich espressos to creamy lattes, refreshing cold brews, and indulgent specialty drinks.
<br />
At CoffeeHut, we believe coffee brings people together. Whether you’re catching up with friends, studying, working, or just taking a quiet pause from your day, our café offers a warm and inviting atmosphere that makes every visit special. Every sip tells a story — of passion, flavor, and the joy of simple moments.
<br />
Step inside, feel the aroma, and let CoffeeHut be your go-to place for connection, relaxation, and, of course, unforgettable coffee.</p>
